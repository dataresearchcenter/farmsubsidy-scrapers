# FarmSubsidy.org Scrapers

[FarmSubsidy](https://farmsubsidy.org) is a platform that collects payment data related to the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which accounts for approximately one-third of the EU budget. This repository focuses on the initial data collection phase, often using web scraping. However, many EU member states now offer bulk data downloads, reducing the need for scraping.
